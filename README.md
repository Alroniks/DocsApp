# MODX DocsApp

The DocsApp is a slim application that serves up the [MODX documentation](https://github.com/Mark-H/Docs) from markdown format into a fully functional site.

It's in development, help is welcome.

Version-specific copies of the documentation should go into the `/doc-sources` directory. Then point a webserver at the `/public` directory to browse the documentation.
